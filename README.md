Welcome to Crazy Cannons!

My game submission for AC31009 Games Programming at the University of Dundee.

Crazy Cannons is all about firing your character from a cannon as far as you can! The further they go, the more money you make.
Along the way, you may run into some friendly and not-so-friendly characters who are either out to help or hinder you. Use all the tools 
at your disposal, including upgradeable launchers and guns, to send your character to infinity and beyond.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

This repository only contains the assets required to build the game but this is all you need! Simply extract the Assets folder into a blank
project folder and open said project folder in Unity. Once Unity has imported the project, choose File >> Build and Run to build and
run the game. Note that Crazy Cannons was built in Unity version 2017.4.10f1, so may experience compatibility issues with differing
versions of Unity.

For anyone that doesn't have Unity installed, I have added a Builds folder containing a Windows executable so that you can run the game
without building.
